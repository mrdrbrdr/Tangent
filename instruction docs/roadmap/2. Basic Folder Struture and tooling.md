## **2. Basic Folder Structure & Tooling** ✔️

Below is a low-level roadmap for Step 2: Basic Folder Structure & Tooling. Follow these instructions, and by the end you’ll have a clean, organized project structure plus some essential tools ready for coding. I’ll assume you’re starting from your repository’s root directory (the one where .git and README.md exist).

### **2.1 Create the Core Directories**✔️

1. **src/client**
    - Will hold all front-end code (Vue components, assets, etc.).

2. **src/server**
    - Will contain Express server code, including routes, controllers, models, etc.

3. **config**
    - Place environment configuration files or other config artifacts here (for now, mostly optional).

4. **docs**
    - Store any additional documentation, diagrams, design notes, etc.

5. **tests** _(optional at this stage)_
    - If you plan to write unit or end-to-end tests, this is a good place to keep them.

#### **Commands to create directories (Windows)**

```
mkdir src
cd src
mkdir client server
cd ..
mkdir config docs tests
```

_(If you’re on PowerShell, these commands still work. Or you can create them via File Explorer.)_

---

### **2.2 Initialize `package.json`** ✔️

1. **From Your Project Root** (where `.git` is located):
```
npm init -y
```
- This auto-generates a `package.json` with default values.

2. **Open `package.json`** in your text editor:
- Update the `"name"`, `"version"`, and `"description"` fields to something relevant, e.g.:
```
{
  "name": "tangent",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A non-linear chat platform (MVP)"
  ...
}
```
- You can also add a `"private": true` field to indicate this isn’t meant for npm registry publication.


---

### **2.3 Install Core Dependencies**

We’ll add a few basics now—Express for the server, Prisma for DB, plus some useful dev tools.

1. **Express & Prisma**✔️
```
npm install express prisma
```
- **express** is our Node.js framework for HTTP routing.
- **prisma** is our ORM for database access.

2. **OpenAI** (for the LLM integration, used later) ✔️
```
npm install openai
```

3. **Dev Dependencies**✔️
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon @prisma/client
```
- **nodemon** automatically restarts your server on file changes (useful during development).
- **@prisma/client** is required to interact with your DB after Prisma migrations.

4. **Optional**: If you anticipate needing other libraries soon (like `cors`, `axios`, etc.), you can install them now or as needed.
    

---

### **2.4 Add Scripts to `package.json`**✔️

Inside `package.json`, add a “scripts” section if it doesn’t already exist. For example:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/server/index.js",
    "start": "node src/server/index.js",
    "migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
    "prisma": "prisma"
  },
  ...
}
```

- **dev**: runs your server via nodemon so it restarts whenever you change server files.
- **start**: runs the server with standard Node (useful in production).
- **migrate**: a shortcut to run your Prisma migrations.
- **prisma**: a shortcut to run any Prisma command, e.g. `npm run prisma -- db pull`.

_(We’ll flesh out `index.js` and migrations in later steps, but it’s good to have these scripts ready.)_

---

### **2.5 Verify Folder Structure**✔️

After these steps, your repository might look like this:
```
tangent/
  ├─ src/
  │   ├─ client/
  │   │   └─ (empty for now)
  │   ├─ server/
  │   │   └─ (empty for now)
  ├─ config/
  ├─ docs/
  ├─ tests/
  ├─ .gitignore
  ├─ package.json
  ├─ package-lock.json
  └─ README.md
```
_(Exact filenames may differ, but this is the gist.)_

#### **.gitignore** Reminder✔️

- Make sure you have a `.gitignore` in the project root with entries like:
```
node_modules/
.env
*.log
```
- so you don’t accidentally commit sensitive or large files.

---

### **2.6 Confirm Everything Works** ✔️

1. **Check `npm install`** ✔️
    - You should see `node_modules/` in your directory after installation.
    - In `package.json`, `dependencies` should now list `express`, `prisma`, etc.

2. **Run `npm run dev`** _(You’ll need an `index.js` in `src/server` soon, even if it’s just a “Hello World”)_: ✔️
    - For now, it might give an error if `index.js` is missing. That’s okay—we’ll add it in the next step.

3. **Commit to Git** ✔️
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "Set up initial folder structure and tooling"`

### **What’s Next?** ✔️

With the directories created and basic tooling installed, you’re ready to set up the **Prisma** configuration and initial DB schema (Step 3). That will involve:
- `npx prisma init` (creating your `prisma` folder and `.env` placeholders)
- Setting `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"` in your `.env` (for SQLite)
- Defining your schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Running your first migration to generate the `dev.db` file

But first, make sure your folder structure and `package.json` scripts are in place and that you’ve committed your changes. If you have any questions, let me know—otherwise, we can move on to **Step 3: Database Setup (SQLite + Prisma)**!
