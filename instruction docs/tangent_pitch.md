# Tangent: 

*Organize your conversations, never lose a thread!*

## The Problem

Current conversational AI interfaces are inherently linear, which causes significant challenges for users who engage in complex or exploratory discussions. Conversations become a long, scrolling thread of mixed topics, where:

•  Users lose context as the discussion evolves.

•  Going on tangents disrupt the flow of discussions.

•  The lack of organizational tools forces users to restart conversations frequently, resulting in fragmented threads across multiple conversations.

• Users cannot easily revisit or re-integrate insights gained in tangents back into the main conversation, leading to inefficiency and frustration.

## The Solution
Tangent is an AI-powered conversational platform designed to enable structured, non-linear discussions.

With Tangent, users can create and manage "conversation branches," allowing them to explore tangential topics without disrupting the main thread.

## Key Features
### Branching Conve﻿rsations
- Main Branch: The core of the discussion, where the user starts the conversation.

- Tangents: At any point in the conversation, the user can create a tangent (sub-thread) by clicking a "Fork" button. Tangents are visually linked to the main branch. Users can create tangents within tangents, enabling exploration of deeply nested subtopics.

### Visual Overview
- The Conversation Map offers a bird's-eye view of all branches and tangents.

Similar to Obsidian’s network view, users can zoom in/out and navigate seamlessly between nodes, making it easy to track the progression of the discussion.

### Summarize & Reintegration
- After concluding a tangent, users can click a "Conclude Tangent" button. The system automatically generates a concise summary of the tangent and integrates it back into the main branch.

- Summaries are visually represented as orbs at the tangent's entry point. Hovering over the orb displays the summary, and clicking allows users to reopen the tangent for further exploration.

### Selective Deletion
- Deleting specific outputs or parts of a conversation for effectiently rewinding a thread to a prior state. This allows users to retry questions or refine their approach without restarting the entire conversation.
