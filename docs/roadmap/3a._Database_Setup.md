Below is a **refined schema.prisma** that follows our new approach: **one record per user+AI exchange** (including userInput, aiResponse, and summaries) and a self-relation (`parentNodeId`) for branching. Since we want tangents to only occur off of AI responses, this single table approach makes sense: each “node” is effectively “one user prompt + one AI reply.” We’ll call it **Node**. We've included the `Conversation` and `User` models for completeness.

This structure should give us a clear foundation for branching logic, conversation ownership, and the difference between main vs. tangent threads.

## Proposed Schema: Single “Node” for Each User+AI Pair

``` prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite" // or "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id          Int            @id @default(autoincrement())
  email       String         @unique
  createdAt   DateTime       @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime       @updatedAt

  conversations Conversation[]
}

model Conversation {
  id          Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId      Int
  user        User        @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

  title       String?
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt

  // One conversation can have many nodes
  nodes       Node[]
}

model Node {
  id             Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  
  // The conversation this node belongs to
  conversationId Int
  conversation   Conversation @relation(fields: [conversationId], references: [id])

  // If this is a tangent, which node did we fork from?
  parentNodeId   Int?
  parentNode     Node?       @relation("NodeToNode", fields: [parentNodeId], references: [id])
  childNodes     Node[]      @relation("NodeToNode")

  // The user prompt that triggered this node
  userInput      String
  // The AI response to that prompt
  aiResponse     String

  // Summaries for the entire user+AI exchange
  summaryShort   String
  summaryLong    String

  // Distinguish main path from tangents
  branchType     BranchType  // e.g., 'MAIN' or 'TANGENT'

  createdAt      DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime    @updatedAt
}

enum BranchType {
  MAIN
  TANGENT
}
```

### Explanation & Justifications

1. **One Table for the Entire “Exchange”**
    - Each row is one user prompt (`userInput`) plus the LLM reply (`aiResponse`).
    - Since we only want tangents to happen from an AI response, that’s effectively the same as saying “fork from this node.”

2. **`parentNodeId`**
    - If the user chooses to tangent off node #5’s AI response, we create a new node with `parentNodeId = 5`, `branchType = 'TANGENT'`.
    - If it’s a continuation along the main thread, we create a new node with `branchType = 'MAIN'` (and possibly `parentNodeId` referencing the previous main node so we can see the chain of main messages).

3. **Summaries**
    - Because our single “node” row represents the entire user→AI exchange, it’s easy to store short/long summaries relevant to that exchange.

4. **Conversations**
    - Each node belongs to a `Conversation` (via `conversationId`).
    - That conversation is owned by a `User` (so the same user might have multiple conversations).

5. **Tangent Logic**
    - In code, if someone forks from node #7, you create a new node with `parentNodeId = 7` and `branchType = 'TANGENT'`. That new node has a brand-new userInput and aiResponse.
    - You only need to check that the parent is an existing node in the same conversation.

6. **Why We Distinguish 'MAIN' vs. 'TANGENT'**
	- An important goal for this project is to present conversations in a way that clearly separates the main line of thought from any tangential side discussions. We achieve this by labeling each node with `'MAIN'` or `'TANGENT'`. Nodes on the main thread (`'MAIN'`) are rendered as a single, continuous vertical line—this is the primary flow of the conversation.
	- When the user chooses to fork off a subtopic (i.e., create a tangent), that new node is marked as `'TANGENT'` and is visually drawn branching off to the side of the main line. 
	- This labeling system makes it easy to identify which parts of the conversation belong to the primary discussion and which parts are exploring tangential ideas. As a result, the UI can render an intuitive “map” of the conversation, enabling users to differentiate the core path from any tangential thought processes.

7. **No “role”**
    - We don’t need a “role” field here, because we’re not splitting user and AI into separate rows. If we prefer to track partial progress (like a user typed something or an AI is streaming tokens), then we’d consider two separate messages. But for our current approach (a node is the final pair of user question + AI response), we’re set.

## Next Steps (Step 8: Branching Logic Implementation)

Once we implement this schema:
1. **Run**:
``` bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name "branching_schema"
```

2. **Update** our code that creates new nodes:
    - Now each time we get a user prompt, we call the LLM for an AI response, then create a `Node` record with that data.
    - If it’s the first node in the conversation, set `branchType = 'MAIN'` and `parentNodeId = null`.
    - If it’s branching from node #N, set `parentNodeId = N` and `branchType = 'TANGENT'`.

3. **Front-End**:
    - We can create a “Fork” button on each node, which calls a new endpoint or passes a `parentNodeId` to the existing route.

**Then** your “Overview” can show each node as an orb or circle in a tree layout. Parent-child relationships come from `parentNodeId`. `'MAIN'` vs. `'TANGENT'` helps us decide how to style them in the UI.
